        heading: "Key Factors Governing Invisible Grill Pricing",
        text: "Invisible grill cost depends heavily on raw material metallurgy. SS316 marine-grade stainless steel with embedded molybdenum is mandatory for coastal Chennai to prevent pitting rust. Other variables include cable thickness (2.0mm to 3.0mm), track extrusion strength, and horizontal versus vertical tension orientation.",

        text: "Traditional iron grills need repetitive repainting, rust easily in coastal salt mist, and block natural daylight. Marine SS316 invisible grills require zero painting, offer a clean 180-degree scenic view, and provide over 400kg of tensile fall resistance.",
