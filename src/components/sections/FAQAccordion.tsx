      question: "Are your on-site measurement consultations free throughout Chennai?",
      answer:
        "Yes! Our technicians visit your doorstep anywhere in Chennai free of charge with laser measurement devices and physical wire/mesh samples. You receive a transparent, itemized quotation with zero obligation.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between invisible grills and traditional balcony grills?",
      answer:
        "Invisible grills utilize slim, high-tensile SS316 marine stainless steel cables wrapped in protective transparent nylon. They withstand over 400kg of load while delivering an unobstructed 180-degree scenic view, whereas iron bars block light, rust easily in Chennai's coastal moisture, and create a cage-like feeling.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a standard balcony safety net installation take?",
      answer:
        "Most residential balcony safety net or invisible grill installations are completed in 2 to 4 hours. Our technicians use low-vibration diamond core bits and vacuum dust extractors to leave your home completely clean.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can children or household pets push through or chew the safety barriers?",
      answer:
        "No. Our child safety nets feature 25mm tight mesh apertures with 150kg+ breaking limits, and our pet invisible grills use chew-proof SS316 marine cables spaced at 2 inches, completely eliminating slip-through risks.",
    },
    {
      question: "What warranty coverage is included with Ram Enterprises installations?",
      answer:
        "We issue an official 3 to 5 Year Service & Replacement Warranty Card covering material strength, tension retention, and anti-corrosion performance under Chennai's outdoor climate.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you install anti-bird pigeon nets and spikes for apartments and AC ledges?",
      answer:
        "Yes, we specialize in humane pigeon netting and stainless steel blunt-tip bird spikes that permanently prevent birds from nesting on AC outdoor units, light wells, and balconies without harming them.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do ceiling cloth drying hangers save balcony space?",
      answer:
        "Our ceiling cloth drying systems use dual-pulley mechanisms with individual SS304 stainless rods that lower to chest height for easy clothes hanging and hoist to the ceiling, keeping 100% of your balcony floor open.",
